Hazrat Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA) was known for his courage, justice, and
 strong faith. Before accepting Islam, he was a fierce opponent of the
  Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and the Muslims.
 One day, he set out to harm the Prophet (PBUH), but on his way, he 
 heard verses from the Qur’an being recited. These words touched his 
 heart deeply, and he realized the truth of Islam.
After embracing Islam, Hazrat Umar (RA) became one of the Prophet’s 
closest companions. He was known for his strict justice and fairness,
 even as a ruler. During his Caliphate, he established
 a strong administration, introduced public treasury, and ensured 
 rights for the poor and weak.
Hazrat Umar (RA) once famously said: “If a dog dies hungry in the 
streets of Madinah, I will be accountable before Allah for it.” This 
shows his deep sense of responsibility and care for all living beings.
He was eventually martyred in 644 CE while leading prayers in the 
mosque of Madinah. His life is remembered as an example of courage, 
honesty, and dedication to Islam.
